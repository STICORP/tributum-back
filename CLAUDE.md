# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Tributum is currently an empty project in its initial setup phase. The project name suggests it may be related to financial, tax, or payment systems.

## Project Status

- **Current State**: Python project initialized with uv
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.13
- **Build System**: uv (Python package manager)

## Development Setup

As this project is not yet initialized, the first step will be to choose and set up the appropriate technology stack based on the requirements.

## Development Guidelines

### Library Version Policy
- **ALWAYS use the absolutely latest version of any library** when adding dependencies
- Only use older versions if there are compatibility issues with other project dependencies
- This policy ensures we have the latest features, performance improvements, and security patches

## Notes

This file should be updated as the project develops to include:
- Build, test, and lint commands once a technology stack is chosen
- High-level architecture decisions as they are made
- Key development workflows specific to this project
