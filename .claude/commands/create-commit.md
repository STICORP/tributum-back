# /create-commit

Analyze project changes and create logical commits using conventional commit messaging.

## CRITICAL: Prohibited Content in Commit Messages

**You MUST NEVER include ANY of the following in commit messages:**

### Prohibited Patterns:
- `ðŸ¤–` emoji or any AI-related emojis
- `Generated with [Claude Code]` or similar attribution
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any AI co-author lines
- References to being "AI-generated", "AI-assisted", "automated"
- Any mention of Anthropic, Claude (except when legitimately part of the change description, e.g., "update CLAUDE.md")

### Why This Matters:
- Commit history should reflect human decisions and reasoning
- AI attribution is not relevant to the change itself
- Professional repositories don't include tool attribution in commits

### Self-Check Before Committing:
After composing a commit message, you MUST ask yourself:
"Does this message contain ANY attribution to AI tools?"
If yes, remove it before proceeding.

## Instructions

When analyzing changes:

1. **Review all changes** - Use `git status` and `git diff` to understand what has been modified
2. **Group changes logically** - Split commits by:
   - Feature/functionality
   - File purpose (e.g., tests, docs, config)
   - Module or component
   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit

3. **Use conventional commit format**:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <subject>

   <body>

   <footer>
   ```

4. **Commit types**:
   - `feat`: New feature
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc)
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
   - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
   - `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
   - `perf`: Performance improvements
   - `build`: Build system changes
   - `ci`: CI/CD changes

5. **Commit message guidelines**:
   - Subject line: Clear, concise summary (50 chars max)
   - Body: Explain WHAT changed and WHY (not how)
   - Include design decisions and reasoning
   - Describe the problem being solved
   - Mention any trade-offs or alternatives considered
   - **FORBIDDEN**: Never mention AI assistance or automated generation
   - **FORBIDDEN**: Never include references to Claude Code, Anthropic, or AI tools
   - **FORBIDDEN**: No ðŸ¤– emojis or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" lines

6. **Multiple file handling**:
   - If changes span multiple files but serve one purpose, commit together
   - If files serve different purposes, create separate commits
   - Stage files selectively using `git add <file>`

7. **Example commit message**:
   ```
   feat(auth): implement JWT authentication system

   Added JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints. Chose JWT over
   session-based auth for stateless operation and better scalability.

   Key decisions:
   - Used RS256 algorithm for enhanced security
   - Token expiry set to 24 hours with refresh token support
   - Implemented middleware for route protection

   This establishes the foundation for user authentication across
   the application and enables secure API access.

   [END OF COMMIT MESSAGE - NO ADDITIONAL CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE]
   ```

## Automatic CHANGELOG Updates

**IMPORTANT**: CHANGELOG.md updates should be included in the main commit, NOT as a separate commit.

Before committing, check if CHANGELOG.md needs updating:

1. **Parse commit message** to determine change type and description
2. **Map commit types to changelog categories**:
   - `feat:` â†’ `### Added`
   - `fix:` â†’ `### Fixed`
   - `docs:` â†’ `### Changed` (only if significant)
   - `refactor:` â†’ `### Changed`
   - `perf:` â†’ `### Changed`
   - `test:` â†’ Skip (don't add to changelog)
   - `chore:` â†’ Skip (unless dependencies/security)
   - `style:` â†’ Skip (don't add to changelog)
   - `build:` â†’ `### Changed`
   - `ci:` â†’ Skip (unless affects users)

3. **Format changelog entry**:
   - Extract subject line without type/scope prefix
   - Capitalize first letter
   - Rephrase for end-users (not developers)
   - Include key details from commit body if relevant

4. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Add under `## [Unreleased]` in appropriate category
   - Create category if it doesn't exist
   - Avoid duplicates - check if similar entry exists
   - Preserve existing entries

5. **Skip changelog for**:
   - Test-only commits
   - Style/formatting changes
   - Minor doc updates (typos, comments)
   - Dev tool configs (unless affects users)
   - Changes to CHANGELOG.md itself

6. **Changelog entry examples**:
   ```
   Commit: feat(auth): implement JWT authentication
   Entry:  - JWT authentication for API endpoints

   Commit: fix(api): resolve memory leak in handler
   Entry:  - Memory leak in request handling

   Commit: chore(deps): bump fastapi to 0.115.12
   Entry:  - Updated FastAPI to 0.115.12 (under ### Security if security update)
   ```

7. **Include CHANGELOG.md in the main commit**:
   - If the commit warrants a changelog entry, update CHANGELOG.md BEFORE committing
   - Stage CHANGELOG.md along with the other files: `git add CHANGELOG.md`
   - Include both the feature/fix AND the changelog update in a single commit
   - The commit message should focus on the main change, not mention the changelog update

## Pre-Commit Validation (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

Before executing ANY git commit command, you MUST:

1. **Show the complete commit message** you plan to use (display it in a code block)
2. **Explicitly verify** it contains NONE of these:
   - ðŸ¤– emoji
   - "Generated with [Claude" or any variation
   - "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any AI attribution
   - Any reference to AI/Anthropic/automated generation
3. **State your verification** by saying: "Verified: No AI attribution in commit message"
4. **Only proceed** with git commit after this verification

Example validation:
```
Planned commit message:
```
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication

Added JWT-based authentication...
```

Verified: No AI attribution in commit message âœ“
```

## Usage

When I ask you to commit changes, follow these steps:
1. Analyze all uncommitted changes
2. Group them logically
3. Determine if CHANGELOG.md needs updating based on commit type
4. If changelog update is needed:
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with the appropriate entry
   - Stage CHANGELOG.md along with other files
5. Compose commit message following the format above (focusing on main change, not changelog)
6. **MANDATORY: Complete Pre-Commit Validation (see section above)**
7. Execute the commit only after verification (including all files AND changelog if updated)
8. Explain what was done and why, focusing on the reasoning behind the implementation
