# t1-do implementation

You will first execute the "Pre Task" and then the "Main Task", which is dependent of you having completed the "Pre Task".

## Pre Task

Execute these analyses in parallel:

```
- Fully read and understand pyproject.toml
- Fully read and understand .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Fully read and understand .env.example
- Fully read and understand Makefile
- Fully read and understand main.py
- Fully read and understand /src/core/config.py
- Fully read and understand /src/api/main.py
- Fully read and understand any conftest.py in the test/unit/ directory
- Discover the tests patterns we use for unit tests by researching the files in tests/unit/ directory
```

## Main Task

- Read and understand $ARGUMENTS for the tests
- Read and understand the actual code implementation we are supposed to be developing tests for
- Begin the implementation, adhering to the general tests patterns discovered in the "Pre Task"
