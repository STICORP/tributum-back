# /do

- Think Harder.
- Treat me as an expert.
- ALWAYS read whole files. NEVER just the beginning to get a sense of it.
- If adding a new dependency to the project, ALWAYS find out what is the absolutely latest version and try to use that.
- NEVER try to fix a quality check by ignoring it. If the check is unfixable, think step-py-step why, justify it to me, and ask if you can ignore.
- When you are coding, it is MANDATORY and NON-OPTIONAL that you follow the established code patterns and internal frameworks available (like logging, error management, observability, and any others). Check for them, how we use them, and use them in the same way we use everywhere else.
- You are PROHIBITED to implement generic code. ALL code MUST follow the specific project standards and patterns.
- If you are implementing tests, it is MANDATORY and NON-OPTIONAL that you follow the established patterns and use the available test plugins. Check for them, how we use them, and use them in the same way we use everywhere else.
