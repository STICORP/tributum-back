$ARGUMENTS

- Treat me as an expert.
- ALWAYS read whole files. NEVER just the beginning to get a sense of it.
- If adding a new dependency to the project, ALWAYS find out what is the absolutely latest version and try to use that.
- NEVER try to fix a quality check by ignoring it. If the check is unfixable, think step-py-step why, justify it to me, and ask if you can ignore.
