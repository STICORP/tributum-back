# /do

- Think harder and make a detailed implementation plan for $ARGUMENTS that strictly follows the requirements below

## Pre-Planning Tasks

- Understand how the requirements in $ARGUMENTS should integrate and properly use the existing codebase
- You should understand the project patterns used and prioritize proper project patterns over any the example code in $ARGUMENTS

## Mandatory Plan Output

- Your plan should clearly describe your understanding of the parts of the code needed for successful implementation of $ARGUMENTS
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to prioritize existing codebase patterns over code examples in $ARGUMENTS
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to properly deal with separation of concerns
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to implement proper type hinting and comply with the project strict mypy rules
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to discover the proper required types and not use the "Any" type in ANY WAY, as it will be caught by the strict mypy rules
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to implement proper code that will comply with the project strict linting rules
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to prevent yourself to use noqa and type ignore comments
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to avoid the usage of imports inside the code instead of at the top of the file
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to make sure to use unittest.mock, we use pytest-mock everywhere in the code
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to make sure to properly use test fixtures
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to prevent yourself from hallucinating and implementing more than what is described in $ARGUMENTS requirements

## Plan Validation

- Validate if your output comply with "Mandatory Plan Output"
