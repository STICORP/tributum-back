## Pre-Planning Tasks

- Understand how the code you will implement should integrate and properly use the existing codebase.

## Mandatory Plan Output

- Your plan should clearly describe your understand of the parts of the code needed for successful implementation of $ARGUMENTS
- Your plan should clearly describe the strategy you will adopt to properly deal with separation of concerns
- Your plan should clearly describe your strategy to implement proper type hinting and comply with the project strict mypy rules.
- Your plan should clearly describe your strategy to implement proper code that will comply with the project strict linting rules.
- Your plan should clearly describe your strategy on how you will prevent yourself to use noqa and type ignore comments.
- Your plan should clearly describe your strategy on how you will avoid the usage of imports inside the code instead of at the top of the file.

- Your plan should clearly describe your strategy on how you will make sure to properly use test fixtures.
