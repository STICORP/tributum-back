# /do

- Think harder and make a detailed implementation plan that strictly follows the instructions below.

## Instructions

- Understand how the code you will implement should integrate and properly use the existing codebase.
- Be sure to properly separate concerns, understand the architecture and properly choose the best place to put the new code.
- Never do imports inside a function. Always put imports at the top of the file.
- Never use unittest.mock, we use pytest-mock everywhere in the code.
