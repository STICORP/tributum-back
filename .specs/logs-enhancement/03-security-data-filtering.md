# Task 3: Security and Sensitive Data Filtering

## Overview
Enhance the logging system's security by extending the existing sanitization framework to cover more data types and provide configurable filtering strategies.

## Project Context

### Current Security Implementation
The project has a well-structured sanitization system:

1. **Error Context Sanitization** (`src/core/error_context.py`):
   - `SENSITIVE_FIELD_PATTERNS`: 20+ regex patterns for field names
   - `is_sensitive_field()`: Pattern matching function
   - `sanitize_context()`: Deep recursive sanitization with type preservation
   - `SENSITIVE_HEADERS`: Predefined list of headers to redact
   - Uses "[REDACTED]" as replacement value

2. **Request Logging** (`src/api/middleware/request_logging.py`):
   - `_sanitize_headers()`: Redacts sensitive HTTP headers
   - Integrates with `sanitize_context()` for query params and body
   - Separate handling for different content types

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Error handler uses `sanitize_context()` before logging
   - Request logger sanitizes all user input
   - ORJSONRenderer handles special types in `_process_dict()`

### Architecture Patterns
- Flat module structure in `src/core/` (no subdirectories)
- Sanitization happens at multiple layers (middleware, error handling, logging)
- Type preservation is important (sanitized data keeps original structure)
- Performance is critical (used in hot paths)

## Tasks

### Task 3.1: Enhanced Pattern-Based Detection
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Files modified**:
- `src/core/error_context.py` - Added value-based detection functions
- `src/core/config.py` - Extended LogConfig with new fields
- `.env.example` - Added configuration examples

**Implementation Summary**:
- Added `detect_sensitive_value()` function with pattern detection
- Implemented Luhn algorithm for credit card validation
- Pre-compiled regex patterns for performance
- Integrated value detection into existing sanitization flow

**Completed Implementation Details**:

1. ✅ Extended `error_context.py` with value-based detection:
   - Created `detect_sensitive_value(value: str) -> bool` function
   - Added pre-compiled patterns for:
     - Credit card: `_CREDIT_CARD_PATTERN` with `_luhn_check()` validation
     - Email: `_EMAIL_PATTERN`
     - Phone: `_PHONE_PATTERN`
     - UUID: `_UUID_PATTERN`
     - JWT: `_JWT_PATTERN`
   - All patterns compiled at module level for performance

2. ✅ Added configuration to LogConfig:
   - `additional_sensitive_patterns`: list[str] - for custom patterns
   - `sensitive_value_detection`: bool = True - enable/disable feature
   - `excluded_fields_from_sanitization`: list[str] - skip specific fields

3. ✅ Enhanced `_sanitize_dict()` and `_sanitize_list()`:
   - Added `log_config` parameter for configuration
   - Integrated value detection as secondary check after field names
   - Skip fields in exclusion list
   - Only processes string values for pattern matching
   - Uses `_get_log_config()` when config not provided

**Test Coverage Achieved**:
- ✅ Comprehensive tests for each pattern type
- ✅ Luhn algorithm validation with edge cases
- ✅ Performance test confirms < 3ms for typical payloads
- ✅ Configuration variations tested
- ✅ No regression - 100% test coverage maintained

**Key Features Delivered**:
- Field name detection remains primary (fast)
- Value detection is secondary (when enabled)
- Configurable via environment variables
- Backward compatible - existing code continues to work
- Performance optimized with pre-compiled patterns

### Task 3.2: Enhanced Sanitization Strategies
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Files modified**:
- `src/core/error_context.py` - Added sanitization strategies and circular reference protection
- `src/core/config.py` - Extended LogConfig with strategy configuration
- `.env.example` - Added strategy configuration examples

**Implementation Summary**:
- Implemented four sanitization strategies (REDACT, MASK, HASH, TRUNCATE)
- Added circular reference protection to prevent infinite loops
- Created configurable per-field strategy overrides
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

**Completed Implementation Details**:

1. ✅ Created sanitization strategies in `error_context.py`:
   - `SanitizationStrategy` enum with four strategies
   - Implemented strategy functions:
     - `redact_value()` - returns "[REDACTED]"
     - `mask_value()` - shows last 4 chars: "****1234"
     - `hash_value()` - returns "sha256:abcd1234" (first 8 chars)
     - `truncate_value()` - truncates with "..." suffix
   - All strategies handle non-string types gracefully

2. ✅ Added circular reference protection:
   - Track visited objects using `id()` in a set
   - Return "[CIRCULAR]" when circular reference detected
   - Pass `visited` set through recursive calls
   - Prevents infinite loops in nested structures

3. ✅ Enhanced configuration in LogConfig:
   - `default_sanitization_strategy`: Literal["redact", "mask", "hash", "truncate"] = "redact"
   - `field_sanitization_strategies`: dict[str, Literal[...]] - per-field overrides
   - Example: `{"credit_card": "mask", "api_key": "hash"}`
   - Fully configurable via environment variables

4. ✅ Maintained backward compatibility:
   - Original `sanitize_context()` signature unchanged
   - New `sanitize_context_with_options()` for advanced usage
   - Default behavior remains "[REDACTED]" for all sensitive fields
   - Existing code continues to work without changes

**Test Coverage Achieved**:
- ✅ All four strategies tested with various input types
- ✅ Circular reference protection verified
- ✅ Per-field strategy overrides tested
- ✅ Non-string type handling confirmed
- ✅ Performance remains efficient
- ✅ 100% test coverage maintained

**Key Features Delivered**:
- Multiple sanitization strategies for different use cases
- Circular reference protection for complex data structures
- Configurable per-field strategies for fine-grained control
- Backward compatible - existing code unaffected
- Type-safe implementation with proper type hints

**Integration Points**:
- Strategies integrate seamlessly with existing sanitization
- Configuration via LogConfig and environment variables
- Works with request logging middleware automatically
- Compatible with all existing error handling

### Task 3.3: Sanitization Performance Optimization
**Status**: pending
**Files to modify**:
- `src/core/error_context.py`
- `src/api/middleware/request_logging.py`

**Current State**:
- `sanitize_context()` uses deepcopy on every call
- No caching of sanitization results
- Regex patterns compiled on every check
- Called multiple times in request pipeline

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Optimize pattern matching:
   - Pre-compile all regex patterns at module level
   - Create `_compiled_patterns` list at startup
   - Use `re.compile()` with re.IGNORECASE flag
   - Cache pattern matching results for repeated field names

2. Implement smart copying:
   - Only deepcopy when sensitive data is found
   - Return original dict if no sensitive data
   - Track if sanitization was needed via flag
   - Avoid copying immutable types

3. Add sanitization caching:
   - LRU cache for field name checks (size=1000)
   - Cache sanitization results for identical inputs
   - Use hash of dict structure as cache key
   - Clear cache on configuration reload

4. Optimize middleware integration:
   - Single sanitization pass in RequestLoggingMiddleware
   - Reuse sanitized results across log entries
   - Lazy sanitization only when actually logging

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use `functools.lru_cache` for caching
- Patterns should be module-level constants
- Consider memory vs speed tradeoffs
- Maintain thread safety with caching

**Testing Approach**:
- Benchmark before/after performance
- Test cache hit rates
- Verify no memory leaks from caching
- Test with various payload sizes
- Ensure correctness not compromised

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 50%+ performance improvement in sanitization
- No increase in memory usage > 10MB
- Cache invalidation works correctly
- Thread-safe implementation
- No functional regressions

### Task 3.4: Security Monitoring and Compliance Helpers
**Status**: pending
**Files to modify**:
- `src/core/logging.py`
- `src/core/error_context.py`
- `src/api/schemas/errors.py` (enhance ErrorResponse)

**Current State**:
- No tracking of what data was sanitized
- No visibility into sanitization effectiveness
- No compliance metadata in logs
- Error responses don't indicate if data was sanitized

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Add sanitization metrics:
   - Create `SanitizationReport` class:
     - fields_sanitized: list[str]
     - values_sanitized: int
     - patterns_matched: dict[str, int]
     - sanitization_time_ms: float
   - Return report from `sanitize_context_with_options()`
   - Include report in debug logs when enabled

2. Enhance error responses for compliance:
   - Add `sanitization_applied: bool` to ErrorResponse
   - Add `data_classification: str | None` for sensitivity level
   - Include sanitization report in debug_info
   - Track if PII was potentially exposed

3. Create security event helpers:
   - `log_security_event(event_type: str, **details)` function
   - Predefined event types: AUTH_FAILURE, PERMISSION_DENIED, DATA_ACCESS
   - Automatic correlation with request context
   - Include in separate "security" log category

4. Add compliance metadata to logs:
   - Data retention hints (via log level or context)
   - Geographic origin (from request headers/IP)
   - Purpose/consent tracking (via context)
   - Regulatory flags (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

**Implementation Notes**:
- SanitizationReport should be lightweight
- Security events should use structured format
- Compliance metadata should be optional
- Use existing RequestContext for correlation

**Testing Approach**:
- Test sanitization reporting accuracy
- Verify security event formatting
- Test compliance metadata propagation
- Test performance impact of reporting
- Verify no sensitive data in reports

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Sanitization metrics available for debugging
- Security events properly structured
- Compliance metadata in logs when needed
- No performance degradation > 1ms
- Reports don't leak sensitive data
